# Voice_Based_Email_for_Blind
The application titled “Voice Based E-mail for the Visually Impaired” is a web-based 
application developed in Python that allows the users to compose a mail and check their 
inbox through the Interactive Voice Response technology. This application not only 
prompts the users with voice commands but also takes their voice input, converts it into 
text using the features like Text To Speech, Speech to Text, Speech Recognition, pyaudio, 
beautifulsoup4, gTTS and pyglet features provided by python. The main advantage of 
the above proposed system is that the use of keyboard and mouse is completely 
eliminated; that is, the user will have to respond through voice commands only.
